* 2019-06-01: Kore is now a C project (called Kinc, short for Kore in C) with a C++ wrapper (still called Kore). For C++ everything should still work the same (in theory) but for one detail: The start procedure is now called kickstart instead of kore.
* 2018-07-08: Kore::Window and Kore::Display have been overhauled and Kore::System was simplified. Projects are now always initialized using Kore::System::init (see Tests/Empty/Sources/Shader.cpp), additional windows are created using Kore::Window::create.
* 2017-02-10: createProject and addSubProject were replaced by the simpler addProject. New code looks like this:

```
let project = new Project('Cool Name');
await project.addProject('aCoolLib');
resolve(project);
```

addProject is asynchronous, please do not forget to await it.

Kore itself is now added automatically so if you used createProject to add Kore, just remove it.

* 2017-04-02: What was previously Kore::Mixer and Kore::Audio is now Kore::Audio1 and Kore::Audio2.
* 2017-03-30: What was previously Kore::Graphics is now Kore::Graphics4.
